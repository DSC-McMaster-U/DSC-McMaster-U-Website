## **“Nvidia Jumps Into AI Music Space With New Audio Generator Fugatto”**

![](nvidia.png)

* Nvidia is entering the AI music race by announcing its new artificial intelligence model, Fuggato, for generating music and audio that can change or add voices and generate other novel sounds.
* The company currently does not have immediate plans to release the technology publicly, but they consider Fuggato, short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, to be a “Swiss Army Knife for sound”.
* The model has the ability to take in and modify existing audio, for instance, by taking a line played on an instrument and then later transforming it into something sung by a human voice with accents and emotions. It also has the ability to take in a recording of someone’s voice and change the accent and tone that it was spoken in.
* Nvidia aims for this technology to be used in the entertainment industry while currently evaluating how to minimize risks if and when they decide to release the model publicly.
* The company is mainly concerned about how this new generative technology can be abused by users in terms of generating misinformation and infringing on copyright laws.

### Hackathons? DEVFEST

Mark your calendars! We’re bringing up an exciting hackathon this November. Keep an eye out for details on team sign-ups and prize announcements soon. This is a great opportunity to put your coding skills to the test, network, and build some amazing projects.

# Current Tech Updates:

## “Internet Saved! Cloudflare Defends World’s Largest DDoS Attack!”

![](cloudflare-logo.webp)

* Cloudflare recently thwarted the **largest ever DDoS** (Distributed Denial of Service) **attack** which peaked at 3.8 Tbps (Terabits per second)
* DDoS attacks aim to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, network or service by flooding them with internet traffic. This attack can prevent the actual users of these servers and networks from accessing them during the attack, which may be severely detrimental to the user and/or the business.
* Most of these attacks **targeted organizations in the financial, internet, and telecommunication industries**. The devices that were infected were spread around the world, but many of them were located in Russia, Vietnam, the United States, Brazil, and Spain.
* The main attack which **peaked at 3.8 Tbps**, lasted 65 seconds and was mitigated autonomously by Cloudflare. This defence provided Cloudflare with the record for defending against the largest volumetric DDoS attack ever, which Microsoft previously held for defending against a DDoS attack of 3.47 Tbps.

## Boost Your Projects: ChatGPT’s Canvas Feature Takes Coding to the Next Level!

![](chatgpt-canvas.webp)

* The **“canvas”** interface opens a separate window, beside the normal chat window, with a workspace for cool projects. Users will be able to generate and write code directly in that space
* It will initially be rolled out in **beta** to ChatGPT Plus and Teams users, followed by the **Enterprise** and **Edu** users next week.
* ChatGPT and other AI chatbots are unable to create large projects based on a single prompt, however, they do **provide a good starting point**.
* Using the “canvas” feature, users will be able to **store their current code** and provide the chatbot with more prompts to improve the result. The canvas will also allow users to **correct some mistakes** in the code that the model has developed. This methodology will mitigate the need to be very explicit with the chatbot to prevent it from making that mistake, which may result in a **completely new code**.
* Users can also use the **UI** to request the chatbot to add comments, review code and explain parts of the code highlighted by the user.

* As the browser battle heats up, Google Chrome emerges as the best overall choice for its speed, user-friendly design, and extensive extensions. However, alternatives like Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox offer impressive features worth exploring for a more personalized browsing experience
* Key qualities for the best browser would include having fast loading and response times, a clean and intuitive user interface, strong security measures and more
* **Google Chrome:** Known for its overall performance, Chrome boasts a vast library of third-party extensions that enhance user experience and functionality.
* **Safari:** Best suited for Apple device users, Safari offers seamless integration across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, ensuring a consistent browsing experience.
* **Arc:** Designed for productivity, Arc features a dashboard-like sidebar and a split-screen layout, making multitasking more efficient.

**Revolutionizing Game Development:** 

NVIDIA is leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI in game development, making the process more efficient and accurate.

**What is RAG?:** 

This innovative software architecture combines large language models (LLMs) with specific data sources to provide contextual and domain-specific responses without the need for costly model retraining.

**Applications of RAG:**

* **Enhanced Documentation Access:** Quickly find answers about engine features and scripting.
* **Intelligent Code Assistance:** Context-aware code suggestions improve coding efficiency.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Generate placeholder content for quicker iterations during development.
* **Automated Bug Resolution:** Help troubleshoot issues by retrieving solutions from documentation and forums.

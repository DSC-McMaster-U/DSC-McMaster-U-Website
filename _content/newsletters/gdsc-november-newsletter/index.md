### Upcoming Event - 1P13 Python Review Session (November 28th, 6:45 PM - 8:30 PM)

The Open Source team has already hit the ground running and started working on four exciting projects! We can’t wait for them to showcase their progress, and we’re excited to see what they create. Stay tuned for more updates!



# Current Tech Updates:

## “Meta working on a robotic hand that allows AI models to feel and interact with things”

![](meta-robotic-arm.png)

* Meta recently announced that they are working to deliver tactile sensors for AI.
* This AI-powered robotic hand is made to feel and interact with physical objects just as a human would. The goal is to create a hand that can perform delicate tasks with accuracy, such as holding an egg without breaking or adjusting its grip based on feedback from sensors.
* These devices however are not designed for consumers but are instead for scientists so that they can train AI to interact with the environment and exist in a safe manner with humans.
  Meta says that it worked with GelSight to make “Digit360” and Meta will publicly release the code and design for Digit 360 so that it might help in the development for a more realistic virtual environment.
* GelSight will be in charge of manufacturing and distribution which will be available sometime next year.

## Boost Your Projects: ChatGPT’s Canvas Feature Takes Coding to the Next Level!

![](chatgpt-canvas.webp)

* The **“canvas”** interface opens a separate window, beside the normal chat window, with a workspace for cool projects. Users will be able to generate and write code directly in that space
* It will initially be rolled out in **beta** to ChatGPT Plus and Teams users, followed by the **Enterprise** and **Edu** users next week.
* ChatGPT and other AI chatbots are unable to create large projects based on a single prompt, however, they do **provide a good starting point**.
* Using the “canvas” feature, users will be able to **store their current code** and provide the chatbot with more prompts to improve the result. The canvas will also allow users to **correct some mistakes** in the code that the model has developed. This methodology will mitigate the need to be very explicit with the chatbot to prevent it from making that mistake, which may result in a **completely new code**.
* Users can also use the **UI** to request the chatbot to add comments, review code and explain parts of the code highlighted by the user.

* As the browser battle heats up, Google Chrome emerges as the best overall choice for its speed, user-friendly design, and extensive extensions. However, alternatives like Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox offer impressive features worth exploring for a more personalized browsing experience
* Key qualities for the best browser would include having fast loading and response times, a clean and intuitive user interface, strong security measures and more
* **Google Chrome:** Known for its overall performance, Chrome boasts a vast library of third-party extensions that enhance user experience and functionality.
* **Safari:** Best suited for Apple device users, Safari offers seamless integration across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, ensuring a consistent browsing experience.
* **Arc:** Designed for productivity, Arc features a dashboard-like sidebar and a split-screen layout, making multitasking more efficient.

**Revolutionizing Game Development:** 

NVIDIA is leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI in game development, making the process more efficient and accurate.

**What is RAG?:** 

This innovative software architecture combines large language models (LLMs) with specific data sources to provide contextual and domain-specific responses without the need for costly model retraining.

**Applications of RAG:**

* **Enhanced Documentation Access:** Quickly find answers about engine features and scripting.
* **Intelligent Code Assistance:** Context-aware code suggestions improve coding efficiency.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Generate placeholder content for quicker iterations during development.
* **Automated Bug Resolution:** Help troubleshoot issues by retrieving solutions from documentation and forums.
